#Local Model AI-Powered Image Description

Welcome to Local Model AI-Powered Image Description, a template application that uses a locally running AI model to generate descriptions of images. This project is designed for beginners to learn how to build and customize AI-powered web applications.

## Overview

This application allows you to upload an image and receive a detailed description generated by a local AI model. It's a great starting point for building more complex applications that leverage the power of local AI.

## Features

*   **Image Upload:** Easily upload images from your computer.
*   **AI-Powered Descriptions:** Generate detailed descriptions of your images using a local AI model.
*   **Beginner-Friendly:** The code is well-commented and structured to be easy to understand and modify.
*   **Customizable:** Easily change the AI model, prompt, and user interface to fit your needs.

## How It Works

This application is built with a modern web development stack:

*   **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Vite:** A fast and modern build tool for web development.
*   **Ollama:** A tool for running large language models locally.

The application sends the uploaded image to a locally running Ollama server, which uses an AI model (like `llava`) to generate a description. The description is then displayed to the user.

## Getting Started (for Absolute Beginners)

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to have the following software installed on your computer:

1.  **Node.js:** This is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run the application. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Ollama:** This is the tool that runs the local AI model. You can download it from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:** If you have git installed, you can clone the repository to your local machine. If not, you can download the source code as a ZIP file and extract it.

2.  **Install dependencies:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command to install the necessary packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Ollama Model

1.  **Download the `llava` model:** The `llava` model is a great open-source model for image description. Run the following command in your terminal to download it:

    ```bash
    ollama pull llava
    ```

2.  **Start the Ollama server:** To allow the web application to connect to the Ollama server, you need to start it with the correct settings. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    OLLAMA_ORIGINS='*' ollama serve
    ```
    Keep this terminal window open while you are using the application.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:** In a new terminal window, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Open the application:** Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

You should now see the Visionary application running in your browser!

## Customizing the Template

This template is designed to be easy to customize. Here are a few ways you can modify it:

### Changing the Model

You can use any image-to-text model that is compatible with Ollama. To change the model, open the `services/ollamaService.ts` file and modify the `OLLAMA_MODEL` constant:

```typescript
// services/ollamaService.ts

// Change 'llava' to the name of the model you want to use.
const OLLAMA_MODEL = 'llava'; 
```

### Changing the Prompt

The prompt is the instruction that is sent to the AI model. You can change the prompt to generate different types of descriptions. To change the prompt, open the `services/ollamaService.ts` file and modify the `prompt` constant:

```typescript
// services/ollamaService.ts

// Change the prompt to generate a different type of description.
const prompt = "Write a haiku about this image.";
```

### Changing the UI

The user interface is built with React and Tailwind CSS. You can modify the components in the `components/` directory to change the look and feel of the application.

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the important files in the project:

*   `App.tsx`: The main application component.
*   `components/`: Contains the React components used in the application.
*   `services/ollamaService.ts`: Contains the code for interacting with the Ollama API.
*   `types.ts`: Contains the TypeScript type definitions.
*   `index.html`: The main HTML file.
*   `package.json`: The project configuration file.
